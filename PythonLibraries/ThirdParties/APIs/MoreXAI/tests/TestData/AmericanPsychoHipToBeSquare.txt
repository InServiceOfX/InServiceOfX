You like Huey Lewis and the News?

Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Yes, Owen?

No, Owen.

Yes, it is.

In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Hey, Paul!?

Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!
