# I wanted the latest numpy since it was a major version update from 1.x to 2.x.
# However,
# for NVIDIA Optimized Frameworks Containers,
# for 24.06 (or 24.07) container images,
# >>> numpy.__version__
#'1.24.4'
# >>> print(torchvision.__version__)
# 0.19.0a0
# >>> print(optree.__version__)
# 0.11.0
#
# As of 2025-02-12, latest for numpy is 2.2.2.
# Latest for torchvision is 0.21.0+cu124
# Latest for optree is 0.14.0
# Otherwise, this error is obtained:
# >>> import torchvision
#
# A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
# NumPy 2.2.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
# versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
# Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.
#
# If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
# downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
# We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2
#
# optree needed to be upgrade because otherwise,

# upgrading optree using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade 'optree>=0.13.0'`.
