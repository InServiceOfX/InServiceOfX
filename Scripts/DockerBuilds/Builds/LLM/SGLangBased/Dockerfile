# As of March 26, 2024, there's 24.03.
# By doing nvcc --version, one can see that from 24.03, CUDA is 12.4. From
# 24.02, CUDA is 12.3.r12.3. For OpenCV and this issue, let's stay with < 12.4.
# Issue: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3690
# Furthermore, cudnnRNNForwardInference was removed in 9.0 of cuDNN:
